Access <a href="https://alex16-csharp.github.io/rock-paper">link</a>

This is a small project i made, its a Rock Paper Scissors, using vanila Java-Script

The rules are not interchangeable.

if the player choses "Scissors" and the computer move  is Rock result will be "Computer Wins",
or when the computer move is Paper then the result will be "You Win"
                
when the player choses "Paper" and the computer move is "Rock" result will be "You Win"
or when the computer move is "Scissors" then the result will be "Computer Wins"

the last move a player can chose is "Rock", when the computer choses "Paper" the result will be "Computer Wins",
or if the computer choses "Scissors" the resu will be "You Win"

there is an instance when both players chose the same move, and then, the result will always be "Tie", it's a pretty simple game for more instructions follow this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors">link</a>
